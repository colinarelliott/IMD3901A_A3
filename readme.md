#### Prompt:
This repository contains code for an assignment related to one of my university courses. It's an A-Frame NodeJS application. Here's the prompt:
- "Create a WebXR application that allows two participants to collaborate and compete in an interactive space that includes interaction feedback (e.g., visual, aural, and/or haptic)."
- Must include a system connecting 2 users via WebSockets
- Must include at least 1 collaborative multi-user interaction
- Must include at least 1 competitive multi-user interaction
- Visual feedback is essential, demonstrate the state of the system

#### Idea:
- make a crane board game where each player controls a crane and has to collect containers and load a ship
- competitive mode: play against each other, see who can collect the most
- co-op mode: play with each other collecting as many as possible during a time limit
